# Scientific Calculator Project

This project was developed during my Programming Fundamentals course using C++. The application simulates a comprehensive scientific calculator with a user authentication system.

## Login Form

The application begins with a login form that features the university's logo. Below the logo, users must enter valid credentials (username and password) to proceed. If the credentials are correct, a message confirms that the login is successful, and the calculator interface is then displayed.

## Calculator Features

The calculator offers multiple modes and options:

### Simple Mode

- Perform basic arithmetic operations like:
  - Addition
  - Subtraction
  - Multiplication
  - Division
  - Functions like clear screen (CS) and clear (C)

### Scientific Mode

- Execute advanced functions such as:
  - Trigonometric calculations (sin, cos, tan)
  - Modulus
  - Exponential
  - Binary conversion
  - Power
  - Octal conversion
  - Logarithmic functions (log, ln)
  - Square root
  - Constants like Ï€ (pi)

### Temperature Conver
